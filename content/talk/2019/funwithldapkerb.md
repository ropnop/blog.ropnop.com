talkTitle: "Fun With LDAP and Kerberos: Attacking AD from Non-Windows Machines"
conference: "Troopers"
location: "Heidelberg, Germany"
date: 2019-03-21
summary: ""
type: "talk"
talkSummary: "You don’t need Windows to talk to Windows. This talk will explain and walk through various techniques to (ab)use LDAP and Kerberos from non-Windows machines to perform reconnaissance, gain footholds, and maintain persistence, with an emphasis on explaining how the attacks and protocols work.

This talk will walk through some lesser known tools and techniques for doing reconnaissance and enumeration in AD environments, as well as gaining an initial foothold, and using credentials in different, stealthier ways (i.e. Kerberos).

While tools like Bloodhound, CrackMapExec and Deathstar have made footholds and paths to DA very easy and automated, this talk will instead discuss how tools like this work “under-the-hood” and will stress living off the land with default tools and manual recon and exploitation.

After discussing some of the technologies and protocols that make up Active Directory Domain Services, I’ll explain how to interact with these using Linux tools and Python. You don’t need a Windows foothold to talk Windows - everything will be done straight from Linux using DNS, LDAP, Heimdal Kerberos, Samba and Python Impacket."
